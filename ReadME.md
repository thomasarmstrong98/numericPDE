# NumericPDE

A repository containing practical implementations of the finite-difference method to partial differential equations. 
This repository contains some projects from a module I completed at York, as well as some of my own work. The code written in this repository should be able to run in both MATLAB and Octave.
For the projects from my numerical methods for PDEs module at York, there are pdf documents accompanying the code to explain the problems I was trying to solve.
